"""A differentiable register machine over the residue algebra.

:mod:`lamb.alu` composes an answer from the latent slots using the expression tree
**read from the input**. That is legitimate for synthetic arithmetic -- the tree is
the question, not the key -- but it is exactly what a natural-language problem does
not come with, and it is therefore the wall between this model and any benchmark
whose input is prose.

So the structure stops being given and starts being *emitted*. The latents become
**registers** holding values, and the model produces a short **program** over them:
at each step, an operation and two pointers to registers it has already written.
The algebra executes the program. Nothing about the execution is learned, and
nothing about the program is decoded into tokens.

    registers 0 .. N-1      the problem's operands, loaded exactly
    instruction t           (op, ptr_a, ptr_b) -> writes register N+t
    answer                  the last register written

Registers are append-only -- instruction ``t`` writes to ``N+t`` and can read only
registers ``< N+t``. That makes the dataflow a DAG by construction, so there are no
write conflicts to resolve and no way to read a register that does not exist yet.
The pointer mask enforces it rather than a loss encouraging it.

Execution is differentiable in the way that matters: a register read is a *mixture*
over registers weighted by the pointer distribution, and an operation is a mixture
over the three composed results. Both are mixtures of probability distributions, so
both are probability distributions, and a model that is unsure which register it
means composes that uncertainty instead of having to commit to one first. Gradients
therefore reach the pointers from the answer, through exact arithmetic.

This is the piece that distinguishes the design from PAL/Program-of-Thought, whose
interpreter is an external Python process: a non-differentiable executor can only be
trained through imitation or RL, and RL on this model's latent block was measured
inert (ROADMAP 3a-ii). It shares its shape with the 2026 differentiable-executor
line -- arXiv:2604.18907 learns programs through a *neural* executor with
Gumbel-Softmax, arXiv:2606.09930 differentiates an interpreter wholesale -- and
differs in that this executor is exact algebra rather than a learned approximation,
so it cannot itself be wrong.

    """Train the latent core to emit programs; the algebra executes them.

    Wraps :class:`lamb.lotus.LotusTrainer` for the latent block, the hash-partitioned
    problem split and the sampling, and replaces what sits on top: instead of
    predicting the answer's tokens, the latents emit a program, and the answer is
    whatever executing it produces.

    Two losses. ``program`` supervises the emitted instructions against the
    generator's own -- free, because the grammar knows the expression it built.
    ``answer`` is the residue cross-entropy of the executed result, which reaches the
    program heads *through the arithmetic*, so a program can be corrected by the
    answer being wrong even where the gold program is not consulted. Weighting them
    is the curriculum: supervise the program first, lean on the answer after.

    ``rational=True`` swaps the register file for ``(numerator, denominator)`` pairs
    and widens the instruction set to include ``/``. It is opt-in because the integer
    path carries the depth-2 result of ROADMAP 3a-vii and should stay byte-for-byte
    what produced it.

        Redundant residues detect an *ill-formed code* and cannot detect a well-formed
        code for the wrong program -- measured in 3a-xiii, where they converted 1.3% of
        errors into refusals and left 44.6% as confident wrong numbers. That gap is the
        whole remaining safety budget of a design that deliberately never exposes its
        reasoning: if you are not going to read the thought, the system has to tell you
        when not to trust it.

        The signal here is **agreement under resampling**. The heads already expose
        Gumbel-Softmax, so ``n_samples`` discrete programs can be drawn from the model's
        own distribution and each executed exactly. A peaked distribution samples the
        same program every time; a flat one does not. This is the per-problem,
        per-emitter version of ``ptr_sharp``, which at the arm level already separates
        the two outcomes perfectly (sharp -> 1.000, blurred -> ~0.04) -- but unlike
        ``ptr_sharp`` it needs no access to the logits, so it transfers to any emitter,
        and unlike the exact verifier it needs no ground truth, so it survives leaving
        the distribution the verifier was written for.

        Returns the numbers that decide whether it is usable. ``acc_agreed`` against
        ``acc_split`` is the separation; ``coverage`` is what fraction you keep if you
        refuse whenever the samples disagree. A signal that refuses everything is not a
        signal, so both have to be read together.

    """Registers holding rationals: a numerator and a denominator, both packed.

    Division is the operation grade-school word problems are built on -- "half as
    many", "split among four" -- and it is not available on plain residues: an
    inverse exists only for divisors coprime to every modulus, and the moduli were
    chosen for short digit-periods, which is exactly the set that makes small
    divisors non-invertible (ROADMAP 3a-viii). Carrying ``(num, den)`` makes
    division multiplication with the operands swapped, so the instruction set closes
    without a single new primitive.

    **One caveat, and it is not the one it looks like.** A soft pointer read does
    not produce a *blend* of the registers it mixes. Decoding takes an argmax per
    modulus independently, so the winning residues need not all come from the same
    register; when they disagree the CRT lands somewhere unrelated to either input.
    Measured over random pairs, ~30% of soft reads decode to a value that was in
    neither register, and the error is one of **incoherence**, not averaging.

    This is not specific to rationals -- the integer register file has it too, for
    the same reason. Two things contain it. Sharp pointers are exact, and training
    drives pointers sharp (the depth-2 arms reached fully determined pointers, and
    both scored 1.000). And with redundant moduli an incoherent residue vector is
    not a legitimate value, so the range check of
    :class:`lamb.algebra.RedundantResidueSystem` flags it: measured, **100% of
    incoherent reads detected, none silently wrong**. The redundancy built for the
    model's own residue errors turns out to cover this as well, because the range
    check does not care what made the vector inconsistent.

    Training is unaffected either way, since the losses read the distributions
    rather than the argmax.

    A fraction cannot be reduced in residue form, so the pair a program builds is

    ``N/D = 109/4``, and supervising ``N`` against ``109`` would be supervising the
    wrong number. The cross-product residual is the exact statement of "these two
    fractions are equal", it is one target -- zero -- in every modulus, and it is
    built from the ``+``, ``-``, ``*`` the ring already has.

    **It has exactly one degenerate, and it is narrower than it looks.** ``(N, D) =
    (0, 0)`` satisfies the residual for any target. A zero *divisor* alone does not
    get there: ``5 / 0`` gives ``(5, 0)``, whose residual is ``5`` and which the
    criterion rejects at full cost. Since ``a/b / c/d -> (ad, bc)``, reaching ``(0,
    0)`` needs a zero numerator *and* a zero divisor -- ``0 / 0``. That is reachable
    (one-digit operands include ``0``, and a pointer pair may address the same
    register twice), so ``den_zero_coef`` is load-bearing, but for one case rather
    than as a general necessity. ROADMAP 3a-viii's *"division by zero is undetectable
    in the ring"* met from the loss side, where the ring turns out to do better than
    expected.

    of a loss with a known degenerate is how one of them quietly loses the guard.
