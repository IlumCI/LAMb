"""GSM8K through the language bridge: text in, a program out, the algebra executes it.

:mod:`lamb.bridge` had the pieces -- a quantity parser, a resampler, a register
loader -- and no path between them. Nothing in the repo turned a sentence into a
number. This is that path, and it is deliberately thin, because almost none of it
is learned:

===========================================  ==========
text -> frozen encoder -> cached embeddings  **no**
text -> quantities -> registers              **no** (regex + a fixed rational map)
embeddings -> K latents (resampler)          yes
latents -> program over registers            yes
program -> answer                            **no** (exact rational algebra)
===========================================  ==========

**On the gold program.** The roadmap's premise was that a natural-language problem
does not come with one, which is why the bridge looked like it rested entirely on
the outcome-only induction result of ROADMAP 3a-vii -- measured once, at depth 2,
over three instructions. That premise is true of prose in general and **false of
GSM8K**, whose train solutions carry inline calculator annotations of the form
``<<48/2=24>>``: an operation, its operands and its result, in evaluation order.
That is very nearly the emitted program.

So the bridge is not a leap, it is a measurement with a control. The supervised arm
recovers a program from the dataset's own annotations; the answer-only arm
(``program_coef=0``) removes it entirely and asks the same question 3a-vii asked,
on real text. Neither arm is assumed.

**What is not claimed.** The encoder is pretrained, so it has seen these benchmarks,
and "frozen" means its weights do not move, not that the information is absent. The
claim that this design has a zero GSM8K->GSM1K gap *by construction* does not survive
a pretrained encoder and is not made here. What survives is an experiment, which
``--encoder`` makes a one-flag arm: run the same core on a pretrained encoder and on
one that never saw the benchmark, and the difference prices the encoder's prior.
